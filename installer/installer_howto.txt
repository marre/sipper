Following are the steps to build the windows installer. 

Prerequisite
------------
1. Install the "Inno Setup Compiler", version 5 or later from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php 



Steps 
-----

1. Build the Sipper gem. To do that modify the version.rb file under root for proper version
   numbers. Execute "gem build sipper.gemspec". This will create
   Sipper-xxx.gem, where xxx is the right version number. Change version at places in sipper.iss - 
   AppVerName, While copying the gem and in c.cmd while running the gem. 
    
   
1.1 Create all the exes and place them in sipper/bin directory. For each platform. 
   
2. Then change directory to installer/windows installer directory and execute "make_installer.cmd". This 
   will create a directory called c:\sipper_installer.
2.1 For linux and solaris run make_installer.sh
   
3. Then change directory to c:\sipper_installer and start "Inno Setup Compiler 5". Load the file
   sipper.iss in the editor, change the version number as required and select "build -> compile" 
   option from the menu. This will create setup.exe which is the windows installer.
   
3.1 For linux and solaris change dir to /tmp/sipper_installer (tar and zip this dir)
   
4 The only pre-requisite before installing on windows (XP, 2000, or Vista) machine is Ruby 1.8.6 
and Rubygems. 

4.1 Prereqs for Linux and Solaris
    a. Ruby 1.8.6 compiled for Linux
    b. Rubygems installed for Linux
    c. yum install libpcap-devel
