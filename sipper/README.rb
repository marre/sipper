# = What is Sipper?
#
# SIPr pronounced as Sipper is a SIP application testing framework that enables the developer 
# and tester write new and complex test cases with extreme ease. 
# While SIP applications are becoming more and more complex and feature rich the test tools have
# not been able to keep pace with them. 
# Sipper was developed out of the necessity to test ever evolving SIP protocol and 
# multi-faceted applications spanning SIP and Web. 
# As new APIs for SIP application development made writing SIP applications accessible, we felt that
# writing tests for them, which are the cornerstone of agile development processes, should be even
# simpler. Sipper is our solution to that problem.
# Sipper is ideally suited for for feature, interop, regression, acceptance and field simulation. 
# It has Servlet style API that ranges from extremely simple to very feature
# rich and powerful. 
# While on one hand you can write simple test cases and controllers with very few lines of scripts,
# you can go further down the API depth and progressively control any aspect of SIP stack. 
#
# == Getting started
# The best place to get started on Sipper is to read the first few chapters of the Sipper book,
# freely available from the Sipper website, also refer to FAQs when in doubt, if you need help
# with a test case of Sipper syntax then join the community at Sipper mailing list. All of these
# are accesible from http://sipper.agnity.com
